Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, Supabase, UploadThing, Clerk

On a second brach there is my attempt of using Supabase for authentication.

It did not work no matter what. Hours wasted for nothing. Almost got it to work except for a little refresh bug that I was not able to fix. Tried my best, but you know. "skill issue".

hello, it's me again with another update. I have switched to Clerk for authentication but the refresh bug is still there. Send help please.
