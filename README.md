Update:

Railway wanted $5.

"No, thank you," I replied.

I then turned to my friend Azure.

"You will host my app for free, right?"

"No," Azure replied. "Your app is too large."

I didn't believe her, so I spent hours trying different approaches to make it work.

I discovered its competitor, AWS, and decided to give them a shot.

Things didn't go well; the errors kept piling up, and I felt overwhelmed.

Then, I saw a helping hand - it pulled me out. It was the almighty Google himself.

He said to me, "We are better than them. Try our amazing App Engine."

So, I downloaded their CLI, logged in, configured everything, and deployed.

I couldn't believe it. It worked on the first try.

"Okay," I thought, but will the site load?

I clicked on the link they provided.

The site loaded.

It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

*****************

On a second brach there is my attempt of using Supabase for authentication.

It did not work no matter what. Hours wasted for nothing. Almost got it to work except for a little refresh bug that I was not able to fix. Tried my best, but you know. "skill issue".

hello, it's me again with another update. I have switched to Clerk for authentication but the refresh bug is still there. Send help please.

This whole time, after trying everything possible, remaking the auth 2 times, the "bug" was the in the way my css would interact with the LastPass extension that I have.
Sidebar was set to hidden on small screens, and the extension would shrink the screen on login to show a notification. 
Because of that, on initial page load, the sidebar was set to hidden.


I don't know why I did not just inspect the page sooner to see that the sidebar was there the whole time but luckily I did after all.

strigify != stringifyUrl. Even if they look similar. Another hour wasted.
