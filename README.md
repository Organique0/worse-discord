Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, Supabase, UploadThing, Clerk

On a second brach there is my attempt of using Supabase for authentication.

It did not work no matter what. Hours wasted for nothing. Almost got it to work except for a little refresh bug that I was not able to fix. Tried my best, but you know. "skill issue".

hello, it's me again with another update. I have switched to Clerk for authentication but the refresh bug is still there. Send help please.

This whole time, after trying everything possible, remaking the auth 2 times, the "bug" was that I had a css property on a sidebar set to hidden. 
I don't know why would that only trigger on initial page load and dissapeared after reloading but it did.
This is web development for you.
